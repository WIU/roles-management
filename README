== DSS Rights Management

Rights Management (RM) is a people, roles and application management web application
and service developed by the UC Davis Division of Social Science.

== Deployment

RM is designed to be re-deployable in any organization, though there are a few matters
of configuration that need to be attended to:

config/database.yml.example
	Move this file to config/database.yml and set the appropriate values.

config/api_keys.yml.example
	Move this file to config/api_keys.yml and set the appropriate values.

config/environment.rb
	Recode the cas.ucdavis.edu URL to your CAS server, or remove CAS entirely. If you
	decide to remove CAS, also remove the before_filter in
	app/controllers/application_controller.rb.

config/deploy.rb
	You'll likely want to set this to your own Capistrano setup or delete it
	if you do not use Capistrano.

You can also search the code for "INSTALLME" (case-sensitive) in case this README
is out of date.
