== DSS Rights Management

Rights Management (RM) is a people, roles and application management web application
and service developed by the UC Davis Division of Social Science.

== Deployment

RM is designed to be re-deployable in any organization, though there are a few matters
of configuration that need to be attended to:

config/database.yml.example
	Move this file to config/database.yml and set the appropriate values.

config/api_keys.yml.example
	Move this file to config/api_keys.yml and set the appropriate values.

config/environment.rb
	Recode the cas.ucdavis.edu URL to your CAS server, or remove CAS entirely. If you
	decide to remove CAS, also remove the before_filter in
	app/controllers/application_controller.rb.

config/deploy.rb
	You'll likely want to set this to your own Capistrano setup or delete it
	if you do not use Capistrano.

You can also search the code for "INSTALLME" (case-sensitive) in case this README
is out of date.

== Technical Notes
=== Universal ID Convention
There's a terrible important convention regarding the polymorphism of people, groups,
and OUs. For various reasons, we need a global ID for these objects, but the schema
doesn't provide for one. The convention is very simple: a leading digit is placed
in front of the actual ID (regardless of whether it's a person, group, or OU) to
indicate which it is: 1 for person, 2 for group, and 3 for OU.

You almost never need to know this if you properly query against the RESTful API,
e.g., /api/search.json will return IDs in this convention, and /api/resolve.json will
accept them and work just fine.

== TODO
* Implement a unit test to ensure non-api namespace does not respond to XML or JSON (security vulnerability)
